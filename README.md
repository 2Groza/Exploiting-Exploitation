# Zeroth-Order Supervised Policy Improvement

PyTorch implementation of Zeroth-Order Supervised Policy Improvement. If you use our code please cite the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06600).

Method is tested on [MuJoCo](http://www.mujoco.org/) continuous control tasks in [OpenAI gym](https://github.com/openai/gym). 
Our implementation is based on the [TD3](https://github.com/sfujim/TD3) code implementation.
